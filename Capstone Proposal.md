## Roadmap

Sprint 1
User Authentication and Profile Creation: Realistically, you should be able to complete this within the first week. React, Node.js, and integration for basic user management is a well-documented process.

Basic Forum Functionality: Implementing a basic forum structure is achievable within the second week.

Sprint 2
Resource Sharing and Collaborative Projects: This stage involves more complexity. Implementing file uploads, user reviews, and project collaboration might take a bit more time. Plan to spend the full two weeks on this.

User Messaging: Implementing basic messaging functionality can be achieved within the second week, especially since you have already implemented user authentication.

Sprint 3
Events and Webinars: Integrating events and webinars should be feasible within the first week.

Professional Development Tracking: This might involve creating a structured form for users to log their professional development activities. This should be achievable in the second week.

Sprint 4
Search and Filter Functionality: Depending on the complexity, this could take a week or more. Implementing basic search and filters should be achievable within the first week.

Testing and Issue Resolution: Testing your application thoroughly is crucial. The second week of this sprint should be dedicated to fixing any issues identified during testing.

Nice-to-haves

## Nice-to-haves

Notification System: Depending on the complexity, this could be implemented in a week.
External Integrations: These may vary in complexity. You could start exploring these features in parallel with other sprints and implement them based on available time.

Advanced UI Styling: This can be an ongoing process. Implement basic styling initially and enhance it as time permits.
User Testing: Conducting user testing for feedback is essential. Consider starting this process early in the development phase and continuing it throughout the project.

Flexibility: Be flexible with the timeline. Development projects often encounter unforeseen challenges.
